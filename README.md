## _Converts 1.21 resource packs to older versions_

This is a tool created for making texture files for older versions of Minecraft out of the current (at the time of writing) texture files in the game. This is done with the goal of only having to worry about one texture file, and then running a script when ready for release.

This is still a work in progress and is intended for my personal resource pack (renegade) so a lot of features are missing.

## To Do:
- finish conversion of all files
- add default assets
